# Project: Around The U.S.
## About the Project
**Around the U.S.** is a responsive website where a user can have a collection of the pictures of his journey around the US. As of now, the functionalities available on the webpage are:
1. When the page loads, there are six cards intially.
2. User can edit and save his profile details. The updated data will be reflected in the webpage but will be lost while page reload.
3. User can like the images. As of now, the likes will not persist on page reload.
4. User can add a new card with the title and the link for image. As of now, the newly added card will not persist on page reload.
5. User can delete any card if he wishes to.
6. User can also have a closer look of the images by clicking on them.

## Technologies and Standards Used
**The technologies that have been used are:**
1. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
3. JavaScript

**There are various tools that have been used throughout the project design and development:**
| Tools                                             | Usage                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Figma                                             | For referring to the product design specification |
| [TinyPng](https://tinypng.com/)                   | For JPEG/PNG Image Compression                    |
| [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) | For refining and compressing SVGs                 |

**The main concepts that have been emphasized are:**
1. **Responsive Web Design**
    - The webpage has been developed following the *desktop first approach*.
    - The webpage has been designed and developed for:  
        - Maximum Width: `1280px`
        - Minimum Width: `320px`

2. [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
3. [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
4. **BEM Specification**  
  The website is using [BEM — Block Element Modifier](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) methodology to create reusable and understandable components in CSS. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. We are also using [Nested BEM File structure organization](https://en.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/#nested) for CSS.  

5. **Git Conventional Commits Specification**  
  We are using [Git Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history making it easier for people to contribute to our projects by communicating the nature of changes clearly.

## Future Improvements
1. The data on the webpage should persist between page reloads.
2. The user should have ability to add pictures - Done.
